# hi

Hi, I'm Ash, a professional software engineer with 5 years of fullstack javascript development experience. I love mentoring people, and find great satisfaction from seeing them succeed. Whether it be just sharing a helpful resource with you to get you unstuck or guiding you all the way through a 6 month curriculum, I'm here to help.

# stack workshop

I've been upto mentoring peers and juniors in the past few years and would like to keep doing so because I feel driven by this purpose. Setting up `stack workshop` is an effort to channelize this effort so I can keep doing what I like through this channel. I also aim to facilitate any one who finds themselves in a position to help others through mentorship via `stack workshop`.

# self-eval

This repo is a place where a student can plan, log, evaluate and get help (with) their software development journey. The quickest way to get started is by forking this repo and using any project you can find in the `Projects` tab of this repo.

### project

You will find a project titled `101` in the `Projects` tab of this repo. As your new mentor, I'd like you to self-evaluate on a few basic topics before we begin our learning journey together. This helps me to guide you based on exactly where you're at in your learning journey. Go through the cards in the `Inbox` column. If you feel confident about the topic listed, move the card to the `Done` column. If you feel the need to review a topic or have never studied it, move it to the `To do` column. Keep cleaning the `Inbox` column this way until you empty the column or have enough to do on your plate. Now you should have everything in either of `To do` and `Done` columns. 

Now is the time to plan how to tackle your to-dos. You may choose one topic every few days or be able to push through several in a few hours. That's immaterial. What's important here is that you should eventually get everything moved into done. As you keep evaluating/learning the topics, keep the project board updated with what you're working on right now. When you start a topic, move it into the `In progress` column and when you feel confident about what you've learnt in the topic, move it into `Done`. If you get stuck with anything in progress, don't waste your time, just add a note/comment on the card, stating exactly where you got stuck and move it to `Help!`. I will try my best to quickly resolve it by adding a learning resource or providing an explanation on the card itself and move it back in the `Inbox` column. Doing this gives both parties complete visibility on exactly where you're at and what's working out for you.

A quick overview of what the columns mean -

##### Inbox

This is a column where I can push you a card containing resources for a specific topic. A card starts its journey towards the `Done` column from this column.

##### To do

Whatever you plan to work on from the `Inbox` column, then moves here before you get to start. So this column is where you'd have everything you can potentially start working on.

##### In progress

As the heading describes, this column is where you'd have all the cards that are in progress, ideally 1 or 2 at any given time. A card from here can be either moved to either of `Done` or `Help!` columns. If you need help with any card, add a note detailing your problem and what you've tried but hasn't worked.

##### Done

This is where the cards want to go when you feel confident about them.

##### Help!

Cards in this column are basically to-do items for me. I will go through every single one of them, add an alternative resource or provide an explanation inline to get you back to working on it. After that, I will move them to your `Inbox` column and you will take it from there.

### future

I will keep this file up to date with the latest info on how to get the most out of `stack workshop`, and this repo and project.
